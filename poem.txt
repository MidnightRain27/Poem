It's a bit past midnight
work is too heavy and sleep too light
In a city full of people so so loud
I feel so alone when I go out
Its too close to be foreign
Too far to be home
Its hard to be happy, harder to be sane
When you feel so alone.
I realized long ago this is not somewhere I wanna be
I wannd go back home because there I was happy
